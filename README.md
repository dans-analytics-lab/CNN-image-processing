# CNN-image-processing
In this ML project, we will be building on code from Kaggle to find several optimal models for "simple" classification tasks. 4 of these "simple" models will work together as a higher-level ensemble model to accurately classify images into 6 possible distinct categories, adding layers of complexity. 

In each model, we will evaluate how different hyper parameters interact with model f-1 scores and accuracy. Some hyper parameters that we will be fine-tuning include: 

1. Image size and batch size
2. Introducing random noise with Image Generation (random zoom, shear, displacement, rotation)
3. # of hidden layers and # of neurons per layer
